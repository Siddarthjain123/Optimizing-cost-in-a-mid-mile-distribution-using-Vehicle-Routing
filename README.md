Summary :

Optimizing cost in a mid-mile distribution using Vehicle Routing 

Studied Vehicle Routing Problem and heuristics like Clarke-Wright savings algorithm and Sweep algorithm.

Saved 5.3% in transportation cost by implementing the Clarke-Wright algorithm in python with 167 cities.

The “middle mile” — the part of the supply chain in which goods are shipped from a supplier's warehouse to a retail store.
Middle mile delivery is generally handled by large trucking networks.
In order to minimize cost and increase efficiency, there is an incentive to fill the trailers as completely as possible.
Sometimes products are redesigned to cover max volume in a trailer.
This shows the cost involved is huge. We need to lower this cost for max profit to supply chain![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95931199/185597557-a320de0a-1c14-4cc8-a58f-11b48d777be9.png)
